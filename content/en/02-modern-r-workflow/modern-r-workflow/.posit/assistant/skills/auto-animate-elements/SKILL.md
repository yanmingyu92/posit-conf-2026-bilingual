description: 'How to spruce up Quarto reveal.js slides with auto-animate by carrying a small cast of persistent elements (shapes) across slides that grow, shrink, and rearrange. Use this skill whenever the user wants elements that persist/animate/reshape between reveal.js slides, a set of shapes that move or morph across a deck, an "auto-animate" motif, or a bento-style animated presentation in Quarto. Covers the data-id contract, the SCSS-plus-inline split, content and figures inside elements, rotation/3D/filter tweening via the autoanimate-extra extension, and the "enough, not all" pacing rule.'

The goal: take a deck and give it motion by carrying a small, fixed cast of shapes (**persistent elements**) across slides. Each element has a stable `data-id`; reveal.js tweens its position, size, colour, and radius between adjacent auto-animate slides. An element can be a big content region on one slide and a small marker on the next.

Do not call these "morph tiles." Call them persistent elements (or just elements).

## The one rule to set expectations first

**Not every slide has to take part.** The effect works when *enough* slides share the cast to feel intentional. Static slides in between are good for pacing. Never force every element onto every slide. When a user asks for "animate everything," push back gently and aim for a recurring motif instead.

## File structure

A deck is a `.qmd` plus a paired `.scss` (matching the book's example convention):

```yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    width: 1280
    height: 700
    margin: 0
    center: false
    auto-animate-duration: 0.9
    auto-animate-easing: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
    theme: [default, my-deck.scss]
```

`width`/`height` + `margin: 0` + `center: false` (and zeroed slide padding in SCSS) give a fixed pixel canvas whose top-left is the origin, so inline `left`/`top` match what you see.

## The `data-id` contract

Mark adjacent slides `auto-animate=true` and give matching elements the same `data-id`:

```markdown
## First {auto-animate=true}

::: {.panel data-id="review" style="left:470px; top:220px; width:340px; height:360px;"}
:::

## Second {auto-animate=true}

::: {.panel data-id="review" style="left:96px; top:200px; width:800px; height:400px;"}
:::
```

Always set `data-id` explicitly for shapes. Auto-matching by text/order is fine for code and headings but unreliable for a cast of divs.

## Identity in SCSS, geometry inline

This is the key split that keeps the markup sane.

**Identity** (things that rarely change) go in the paired SCSS, keyed on `data-id`:

```scss
[data-id="draft"]   { background: #2E7D6B; }
[data-id="review"]  { background: #E8A33D; }
[data-id="release"] { background: #4A5899; }
```

**Geometry** (per-slide position and size) goes inline:

```markdown
::: {.panel data-id="draft" style="left:96px; top:220px; width:340px; height:360px;"}
:::
```

## Recommended helper classes (in the paired SCSS)

```scss
.reveal .slides section { padding: 0 !important; height: 700px; }

// base element
.panel {
  position: absolute;
  border-radius: 18px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  overflow: hidden;   // clips inner content cleanly during shrink
}

// the "parked marker" state
.marker { width: 40px; height: 40px; border-radius: 10px; }

// set text colour once per slide via a class on the heading
.dark  h2, .dark  .big-title { color: #F1EEE6; }
.light h2, .light .big-title { color: #17251F; }

// let the ## heading double as the slide's small kicker label
.reveal h2 {
  position: absolute; left: 96px; top: 54px; margin: 0;
  font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: .18em; font-weight: 600; text-transform: uppercase;
}

// content that lives inside an element
.card   { padding: 26px 28px; }
.card .h { font-size: 32px; font-weight: 700; }
.card .p { font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.45; margin-top: 12px; opacity: .92; }
```

Use `.dark` / `.light` on the heading (`## Title {.dark auto-animate=true ...}`) so text colour is stated once per slide, not on every span. Use the `##` heading text as the kicker; use fenced divs (`::: {}`) for the big title and elements, not raw `<div>`.

## Content and figures inside an element

An element is a div, so it can hold markdown or a figure. Inner content is unmatched across slides, so it **fades in/out while the element glides** (this is the desired effect; keep `auto-animate-unmatched` at its default `true`).

Text card:

```markdown
::: {.panel .card data-id="review" style="left:96px; top:200px; width:800px; height:400px;"}
[Review]{.h}

[Read it as if you did not write it.]{.p}
:::
```

ggplot2 figure (needs R at render time): put a knitr chunk inside the fenced div.

````markdown
::: {.panel data-id="panel" style="left:96px; top:160px; width:1088px; height:480px;"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 4.8
#| dev: svg
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(...) + theme_minimal()
```
:::
````

Theme the plot to the element's background (e.g. `plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#16273E")`) so it reads as part of the shape.

## Patterns that are NOT bento

Steer users toward varied uses, not just colored rounded rectangles:

- **Code**: the same code block on consecutive auto-animate slides animates added/removed lines. No shapes needed.
- **Agenda / progress rail**: a column of items where the active one enlarges and the rest dim on each section divider.
- **Hero shape**: one recurring shape that reshapes between section dividers (circle → bar → frame), parked as a marker on the quiet slides between. Best illustration of "enough, not all."
- **Zoom to detail**: a grid of cards; one expands to fill the slide, the others park at the edges, then collapse back.
- **Diagram reflow**: boxes/nodes rearranging from a linear flow into a cycle.
- **Stat → figure**: a big number that expands into a panel holding a chart.

## Rotation, 3D, and extra style tweening

Stock reveal.js interpolates only position (translate) and size (scale). Its FLIP engine overwrites `transform` wholesale, so a rotation you author is silently dropped, and it cannot be added through `auto-animate-styles` either. The `autoanimate-extra` extension makes `transform` behave like every other auto-animated property, which brings the effect close to PowerPoint's Morph:

```bash
quarto add emilhvitfeldt/quarto-revealjs-autoanimate-extra
```

```yaml
format: revealjs
revealjs-plugins:
  - autoanimate-extra
```

There are no special attributes: write an ordinary inline `transform`, exactly as you change `width` to animate size.

```markdown
## First {auto-animate=true}

::: {.panel data-id="hero" style="left:96px; top:220px; width:200px; height:200px;"}
:::

## Second {auto-animate=true}

::: {.panel data-id="hero" style="left:540px; top:180px; width:400px; height:400px; transform: rotate(360deg);"}
:::
```

| Effect | Transform |
|---|---|
| 2D rotation | `rotate(90deg)` |
| Card flip | `perspective(800px) rotateY(180deg)` |
| Tumble in 3D | `perspective(1000px) rotateX(55deg) rotateY(35deg)` |
| Mirror | `scaleX(-1)` |
| Skew | `skewX(-25deg) skewY(8deg)` |
| Full turn | `rotate(360deg)` |

Rotations are absolute and may exceed 360° or go negative, which is how you control spin direction and turn count. Transforms compose with the built-in move and resize, so an element can travel, grow, spin, flip, and round its corners in one transition.

The extension also adds `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, and `filter` to the deck-wide tween list. Anything else is opt-in per element with `data-auto-animate-styles`, a comma-separated property list:

```markdown
::: {.panel data-id="shape" data-auto-animate-styles="clip-path" style="clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%);"}
:::
```

Rules that matter when using it:

- **Write the transform inline.** A transform in the paired SCSS is only readable as a computed matrix, so it animates as a matrix decomposition: rotation takes the shortest path and multi-turn spins collapse. Inline is what makes `rotate(720deg)` mean two turns. This is the one place the "identity in SCSS, geometry inline" split extends: `transform` counts as geometry.
- **Use the same transform-function list, in the same order, on both slides.** The extension unions the lists and pads with identity values, but matching them yourself avoids surprises (`perspective()` has no identity and borrows the other side's value).
- The FLIP math assumes `transform-origin: center`; the extension sets it during the transition.
- Reveal supports one global `autoAnimateMatcher`, so another extension that sets one will conflict (last one wins).
- Per-glyph text morph and true SVG path morph are out of scope.

### Code and figure on independent paths

Wrap the chunk in a fenced div carrying its own `data-id` and absolute geometry, and code and plot move separately. `data-auto-animate-delay` on the destination staggers them, so the pair does not read as one block sliding around:

```markdown
## Code, then chart {auto-animate=true}

::: {data-id="code" style="position: absolute; left:30px; top:220px; width:470px;"}
...code block...
:::

::: {data-id="chart" style="position: absolute; left:550px; top:200px; width:470px; transform: rotate(0deg);"}
...plot chunk...
:::

## Code, then chart {auto-animate=true}

::: {data-id="code" style="position: absolute; left:175px; top:130px; width:700px;"}
...code block...
:::

::: {data-id="chart" data-auto-animate-delay="0.25" style="position: absolute; left:275px; top:340px; width:500px; transform: rotate(360deg);"}
...plot chunk...
:::
```

Absolute positioning is what keeps the two independent; a shared `.columns` wrapper would tie them to one layout flow.

The extension repo has `example.qmd` (one slide-pair per capability) and `examples/pinwheel/`, a rotating photo pinwheel recreating a PowerPoint Morph tutorial where each picture counter-rotates against the wheel so the photographs stay upright.

## Positioning workflow

Do not hand-tune every coordinate. Recommend `quarto-revealjs-editable`:

```bash
quarto add EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-revealjs-editable
```

Click **Modify** in the deck menu (or mark elements `{.editable}`), drag/resize on the rendered slide, and save coordinates back to the `.qmd`. Workflow: rough the elements in, then nudge visually.

## Gotchas

- Animating a text block between very different sizes looks bad mid-word. Keep title sizes close, or accept the stretch only on short headings.
- `overflow: hidden` on the base element gives clean shrink-to-marker transitions.
- Raw SVG must go in a ```` ```{=html} ```` block; Pandoc will not pass it through an inline `[]{}` span.
- Fenced divs need the opening and closing `:::` on their own lines; an empty element is a two-line block.
- Book examples never use `self-contained: true`, and `examples/` must be rendered before the book (two-pass build).
- If a non-auto-animate slide sits between two auto-animate slides, elements will not tween across that gap. To keep an element persistent through a "quiet" slide, mark that slide `auto-animate=true` too and park the element as a marker.

## Starting point

The book's worked examples live in `examples/auto-animate/` (`basics`, `agenda`, `hero-shape`, `colored-panels`, `figure-in-element`). Adapt `colored-panels.qmd` + `.scss` as a copy-paste skeleton for a multi-element deck, or `hero-shape.*` for the single-shape approach.
