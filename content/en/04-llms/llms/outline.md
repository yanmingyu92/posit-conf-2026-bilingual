# Programming with LLMs

## Setup thoughts

- Positron Assistant: https://positron.posit.co/assistant
  - Requires turning on settings

- Posit Assistant (recommended extension), requires setting up PA

## Morning 1: Anatomy of a conversation (90m)

> An introduction to basic LLM concepts and how to use `ellmer` and `chatlas` to interact with LLMs from R and Python. No prior experience with LLMs is assumed, but some programming experience is helpful.

- (10m) Welcome, introductions, workshop expectations
  - Activity: introduce yourself to your neighbors
  - Introduce the instructors and teaching assistants
  - Review the code of conduct and conference logistics
  - Direct participants to the workshop website and Discord
  - Preview the schedule and explain the red/green sticky system
  - Walk through the project structure and where to find exercises, solutions, and demos

- (10m) Set-up and verify API access
  - Explain that API access requires a way to verify, a provider account, payment method, (sometimes) an API key
  - Explain that we will be using Posit AI Pass to access models today
    - Explain any setup still needed
  - Briefly introduce Posit Assistant and workshop skill so that learners can use it to get help throughout the workshop
    - Don't explain what a skill is, just mention that it will know about the workshop
  - *Activity* `_exercises/01_hello-llm`
    - Simple script to verify API access (write an "I'm at posit::conf(2026) social media post")
    - Paste into Posit Assistant and ask to critique it
    - Goal is to verify `chat_posit()` and Posit Assistant connected through Posit AI Pass are both working

- (10m) Think empirically, be pragmatic
  - Getting into the right mindset for working with LLMs
  - This section gives us some extra time to troubleshoot any setup issues
  - Treat LLMs as black boxes and test capabilities empirically
  - Use failures as useful evidence while exploring
  - Start with simple building blocks and develop intuition through hands-on work

- (20m) Anatomy of a conversation
  - Show familiar, chatGPT style conversation
  - We can do this from R/Python too! Show ellmer/chatlas code.
  - How does this work? HTTP APIs. Condensed diagram
  - Look at ellmer/chatlas code more slowly, at a high level
  - Show that you can inspect the chat objects. What do you notice?
  - Messages have roles. Show role diagrams
  - Role table.
  - What about the system prompt? Show how to add with ellmer and chatlas. Inspect chat object again.
  - *Activity* `_exercises/02_word-game` (will need renaming)
    - System prompt: _Answer in as few words as possible._
    - R: _What ellmer function creates an Anthropic chat?_
    - Python: _What chatlas class creates an Anthropic chat?_
    - Follow up in the same chat: _What about OpenAI?_
    - Start a new chat and ask only: _What about OpenAI?_
    - Compare both the content and response style.
  - *Demo* clearbot
    - Use same exchange as from the exercise
    - Show that each request contains the system prompt and full conversation history
    - Clear the chat and show the second example again

- (20m) How do LLMs work? (how to talk to robots)
  - Is this actually a conversation? LLMs are stateless - connect to clearbot demo
    - The model does not remember anything between requests.
    - The client resends the full conversation history with each message.
    - The model reconstructs the conversation from that history.
    - A new chat object starts without that history or system prompt.
  - How to make an LLM
  - Tokens as the fundamental unit
  - *Demo* `_demos/04_token-possibilities`. Possibly updated to be more like https://ngrok.com/blog/compression-is-prediction
  - What if I want to chat back-and-forth, like ChatGPT?
    - live_console/live_browser
  - *Activity* `_exercises/05_live` (possibly skip if short on time)

- (20m) Shinychat basics
  - Activity: `live_console()` and `live_browser()` (or `chat.console()` and `chat.app()`)
  - Making your own shinychat app with `chat.ui()` and `chat.append()`. R users can use the chat module with `chat_mod_server()`.
  - Activity: Reverse the word-guessing game with the word to guess in the system prompt. User has to guess, LLM gives hints.
  - Compare console and browser chat helpers in `ellmer` and `chatlas`
  - Activity: use an interactive chat to write a playful roast
  - Build up a shinychat app step by step in R and Python
  - In R, connect `chat_mod_ui()` and `chat_mod_server()` to an `ellmer` client
  - In Python, connect `ui.chat_ui()` and `ui.Chat()` to an asynchronous `chatlas` stream
  - Discuss why each app session needs its own chat client
  - Finish with interpolation examples used to place a secret word in the system prompt

## Morning 2: Programming with LLMs (90m)

> A deeper dive into the things you can do with LLMs when you're programming with them that are harder to do in a chat UI.

- (15m) Choosing a model
  - Distinguish between a provider, which hosts and serves models, and a model, which is a specific LLM with particular capabilities
  - Briefly introduce the major model families from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, with Ollama as an example of running models locally
  - Compare the dimensions that matter when choosing a model:
    - Context window: how much content the model can accept
    - Capabilities: support for images, documents, reasoning, tool use, and structured output
    - Speed and cost: smaller models are generally faster and less expensive
    - Intelligence: larger or reasoning-focused models may perform better on complex tasks
  - Explain how model families commonly offer different size tiers and generations (shorten this section)
    - Moving to a larger tier may improve quality at the cost of speed and price
    - Moving to a newer generation may improve quality without requiring the largest model
    - Model names and availability change frequently, so use provider documentation and independent comparisons rather than memorizing a fixed recommendation
  - Use a practical default: start with a capable general-purpose model, try a smaller model for simple or high-volume work, and move to a larger or reasoning model when evaluation shows that it is needed
  - Posit AI Pass: lets you use models from various providers. We only support models we think are useful for data or coding work.
  - Introduce the provider-specific chat functions/chat() function in `ellmer` and classes in `chatlas`
  - Show how `chat()` and `ChatAuto()` make it easy to switch providers or select a specific model
  - *Activity* `_exercises/07_models`
    - List the models available from Anthropic and OpenAI
    - Send the same prompt to different models
    - Change only the provider or model name, then compare the responses
  - Possible revisions:
    - Move more quickly from the provider/model distinction to the criteria for choosing a model; shorten the seven-slide provider/model diagram sequence
    - Replace the detailed Claude version history with concise, current examples of how Anthropic and OpenAI model families encode size and generation
    - Give local and open-weight models more context, including Ollama, Hugging Face, LM Studio, parameter counts, and common model-naming conventions
    - Replace fixed task-by-model and "favorite models" recommendations with a durable heuristic: start with a recent frontier model, then try a smaller or cheaper model when needed
    - Introduce evaluation with `vitals` as the systematic way to compare model quality and cost for a specific task
    - Keep the existing compare-the-same-prompt activity, adapted for both `ellmer` and `chatlas`
    - Update the provider and model examples to reflect current package support and current model availability

- (15m) Multi-modal input (vision, PDF)
  - Activity: images of food and ask for recipes
  - Activity: take a PDF of a recipe, turn it into markdown

- (15m) Structured output
  - Explain `ellmer::type_*()` or [pydantic model in chatlas](https://posit-dev.github.io/chatlas/get-started/structured-data.html)
  - Activity: Extract rich data from the recipe PDF
  - Note [use_attribute_docstrings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.use_attribute_docstrings)

- (10m) Parallel/batch calls
  - Support will hopefully land in chatlas before conf
  - Activity: Extract recipe data in parallel or batch

- (35m) Prompting engineering and hallucinations
  - Activity: images of mpg vs weight and ask for interpretation
  - Activity (part 1): same question, but we've replaced the image with random noise
  - Activity (part 2): work with partner to try to get the model to give you a decent interpretation of the random noise image
  - Prompt engineering best practices, in particular the system prompt
  - Activity: create [the prompt for the quiz game show](https://github.com/jcheng5/llm-quickstart/blob/main/02-tools-prompt.md)

## Afternoon 1: Agents (90m)

Unit 07: Tool Calling (30m) · Unit 08: Agents (20m) · Unit 09: Agent Skills (25m) · Unit 10: Posit Assistant (15m) · Unit 11: Break (30m)

> Picking up from tool calling to build real agents, ending with agent skills. People have just had lunch, so this is the most intense part of the afternoon; the day tapers off from here.

- (30m) Tool calling
  - Explain how tool calling pattern, mostly following <https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/genAI-2025-llms-meet-shiny>
    - Demo `15_demo_manual-tools`: human in the loop tools
    - Demo `16_demo_tools`: preview of an app with tools
  - Activity `17_quiz-game-2`: quiz show
    - We provide an R/Python function that plays a sound
      - R: `beepr`, Python: [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound3/)
    - They document the function and register it as a tool in the Quiz Show app
  - Activity `18_quiz-game-3`: add tool annotations to give the tool an icon and title
  - `18_quiz-game-3` exercise and solution point interested people to `ContentToolResult` (ellmer/chatlas) and the shinychat tool UI article for richer tool displays

- (20m) Building an agent
  - Picking up from tool calling to build up to agents
  - Hadley/Willison definition: agents are LLMs with a read tool and a write tool
    - Reference: Hadley's series on Substack, in particular [What is an agent?](https://tidydesign.substack.com/p/what-is-an-agent) and [A coding agent is six functions in a trenchcoat](https://tidydesign.substack.com/p/a-coding-agent-is-six-functions-in)
  - Activity `19_agent-1` (8m incl. 3m discussion): build a simple coding agent with a read tool and a write tool
  - Activity `20_agent-2` (8m incl. 3m discussion): make that coding agent a little better with a couple more tools (list files, edit files)

- (25m) Agent Skills
  - Explaining what skills are, how they're used, best practices for making them
  - Activity `21_skills-1` (8m incl. 3m discussion): build on the agent work to wire up a skill tool
    - Options: skill listing in the system prompt, a read tool to read a skill, or make your own skill tool
  - Activity `22_skills-2` (8m incl. 3m discussion): take the skill from the first exercise and improve it (fix common problems)

- (15m) Posit Assistant
  - Demo `23_demo_assistant`: Posit Assistant agent demo to bring everything together
    - Instructor sets up the agent conversation, then students do the exploration themselves
    - Consider adding a skills component to this demo
  - Discussion: what if the assistant could run code? It can — what keeps that safe?
    - Coding harnesses, safety, sandboxing, LLM-based safety checks
    - Reference: [Help! My coding agent can run code](https://tidydesign.substack.com/p/help-my-coding-agent-can-run-code)
  - Leaves room for discussion and free practice time in the tool attendees will actually use

## Afternoon 2: querychat, shinychat, and the future (90m)

Unit 12: querychat and shinychat (60m) · Unit 13: Wrap-up (35m)

> Querychat first, then new shinychat features and a closing conversation. Coding intensity is medium here and minimal by the end: the day tapers off as attendees get tired.

- (60m) querychat + shinychat
  - (20m) querychat
    - Simple variant: use querychat to explore some data
    - Activity `26_querychat`
    - Minimal coding required by this point
  - (40m) shinychat
    - New shinychat features, including `page_chat()`
    - See the shinychat v0.5.0 preview blog post: <https://6aa318ede78a9bc9db955cff--posit-open-source.netlify.app/blog/2026-09-15_shinychat-v0.5.0/>
    - Activity `24_shinychat-1`: put the Blockbuster renewal agent and its full skills infrastructure in a `page_chat()` app, then add a greeting and suggestion cards
    - Activity `25_shinychat-2`: connect the agent to a drafts drawer with `show_letter()`, a poll-backed picker, and an editable `input_code_editor()`
    - Discussion: inspect whether the agent read the current draft before editing a person’s saved change

- (30m) The Future of AI
  - Joe Cheng drops in again for this conversation
  - Where do we go from here? Let's talk fears and hopes.

- (5m) Wrap-up

## Bonus: Augmented Generation (40m)

> We won't cover this unit during the workshop, but the materials are included for anyone who wants to go further on their own. How to add knowledge to LLMs and make them more useful for specific tasks.

- (10m) Manual RAG
  - Activity: Data science coding assistant
    - Given a data science task using `polars` or `dplyr`, ask an LLM to generate or explain code, first without any context.
    - Then, give it the relevant section of the `polars` or `dplyr` documentation and see how much better the response is.

- (30m) RAG
  - High-level overview of how RAG works
  - Activity: Build a dynamic RAG system
    - We'll have the complete, raw `dplyr` or `polars` documentation.
    - Preprocess and compute embeddings for each chunk using `ragnar` (R) or `raghilda` (Python)
      - https://posit-dev.github.io/raghilda/user-guide/chatlas-integration.html
      - https://ragnar.tidyverse.org/articles/ragnar.html#setting-up-rag
    - Add a tool that searches the embeddings and returns the top few chunks
      - ellmer: Use `ragnar`
      - chatlas: this means writing a function
