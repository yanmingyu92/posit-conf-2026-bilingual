# Your skills-wired agent from `21_skills-1` is back, but its skill is a bad
# first draft.
# Open `skills/renewal-letters/SKILL.md` before you continue.
# The skills folder also holds three other skills the agent can choose from.

# %% [markdown]
# **Step 1:** Fix the skill.
#
# Start at the top of `skills/renewal-letters/SKILL.md` and work through these
# questions one at a time:
#
# 1. Read only the description.
# If that were all the agent saw before choosing a skill, what would it know
# to do?
#
# 2. When will the agent read the first two sentences in the body?
#
# 3. Read the rest of the body beside the store files.
# Which parts tell the agent something it cannot already find elsewhere?
#
# 4. Where and how does the skill describe the process the agent should
# follow?
# Is the process clear?
# Is there room for interpretation or confusion?
