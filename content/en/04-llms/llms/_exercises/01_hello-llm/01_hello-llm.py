# In this workshop, we'll be using
# [chatlas](https://posit-dev.github.io/chatlas) to interact with large
# language models (LLMs).
#
# Today we're using Posit AI Pass, so you don't need any API keys! The first
# time you run this, a browser window opens asking you to log in at posit.ai
# with the email you used to sign up for the workshop.

# Many providers, like OpenAI and Anthropic, require API keys to connect.
# Typically, you would:
#
# 1. Sign up for an account with OpenAI or Anthropic
# 2. Add a payment method and get an API key
# 3. Store it in a `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
#
# Then you can use `ChatOpenAI()` or `ChatAnthropic()`, which pick the keys up
# automatically:
#
# ```python
# import dotenv
#
# dotenv.load_dotenv()
#
# chat_gpt = chatlas.ChatOpenAI()
# chat_gpt.chat("Hello!")
# ```
