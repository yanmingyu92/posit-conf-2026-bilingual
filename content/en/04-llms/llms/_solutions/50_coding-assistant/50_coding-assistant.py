# **Step 1:** Run the code below as-is to try the task without any extra
# context. How does the model do? Does it know enough about the NWS Python
# package to complete the task?
#
# **Step 2:** Now, let's add some context. Head over to the GitHub Repo for NWS
# (link in `docs.py.md`). Copy the project description from the `README.me` and
# paste it into `docs.py.md`.
#
# **Step 3:** Uncomment the extra lines to include these docs in the prompt and
# try again.

# %% task
chat = chatlas.ChatPosit()

chat.chat(
    # Extra context from package docs
    here("_solutions/50_coding-assistant/docs.py.md").read_text(),
    # Task prompt
    "Write a simple function that takes latitude and longitude as inputs "
    "and returns the weather forecast for that location using the NWS "
    "package. Keep the function concise and simple and don't include error "
    "handling or data re-formatting. Include a short docstring, including "
    "including examples for NYC and Houston, TX.",
