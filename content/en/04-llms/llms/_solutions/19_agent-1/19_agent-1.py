# STEP 1: Wrap up file reading and writing so the LLM can use them.
#
# pathlib gives us two great methods for reading and writing files:
#
#   * Path.read_text()
#   * Path.write_text()
#
# But we're not going to just give those directly to the LLM! We wrap the
# operations we trust it with into functions and hand those to it as tools.
# For each one, think through:
#
#   1. What inputs do we want from the LLM?
#
#   2. Fill in the function to take action for the LLM.
#
#   3. What text do we send back to the LLM?
#
# Answers:
#   1. Inputs: read_file takes the path the LLM wants to inspect;
#      write_file takes a path and the full contents to put there.
#   2. Work: resolve the path into the workspace (project_dir / path) and
#      perform the file operation with pathlib.
#   3. Outputs: read_file returns the file contents; write_file returns a
#      short confirmation because the LLM learns from what we return.
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """
    Read the full contents of a file in the Blockbuster workspace.

    ----------
    path

def write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str:
    """
    Write a file in the Blockbuster workspace, overwriting it if it exists.

    Use this to create a script or its output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path

    content
        The full contents of the file to write.
